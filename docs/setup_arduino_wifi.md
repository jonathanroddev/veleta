# Hardware setup — Arduino/ESP + MPU-6050 over WiFi

Step-by-step guide to get a board streaming `raw6` frames to the core.
Two boards are supported; **start with the ESP32 if you have one**, it has
far fewer ways to fail.

## 0. First: which board?

| | **ESP32 + MPU-6050** | **Nano/Uno + ESP-01S + MPU-6050** |
|---|---|---|
| Rate | 100 Hz (200 possible) | ~20 Hz |
| Logic levels | 3.3V throughout, MPU wired directly | the 328P board is 5V, ESP-01 is 3.3V → **level shifter required** |
| Power | Single 3.3V rail on the board | ESP-01 peaks ~300 mA; the Uno's 3.3V regulator gives ~50 mA and the Nano has none at all → **separate supply required** |
| Parts | 1 board | 1 board + module + shifter + regulator + capacitor |
| Cost | ~5–8 € | board (owned) + ~3 € + extras |
| Battery-powered for a suit | Straightforward | Awkward (two rails) |

The 328P + ESP-01 path exists because the board is already here (a Nano;
the same sketch takes an Uno with a different FQBN). For anything beyond a
first test — and certainly for a suit of several sensors — the ESP32 is
both simpler and cheaper.

**Whatever you buy, check it is 2.4 GHz** (all of this hardware is) and that
your router exposes a 2.4 GHz SSID: none of these radios can see 5 GHz.

## 1. Find your PC's IP (it is not in the repo)

Every board points at `PC_IP:PORT`, and the IP depends on your machine and
network, so it is **never** committed. Find it:

```bash
# macOS (WiFi interface)
ipconfig getifaddr en0
# Linux
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

The **port** is fixed in the repo: `LISTEN_PORT=1399` in
`core/config.env`. If you change it, change it there and in every
board's `secrets.h`.

> If your router hands out addresses by DHCP, your PC's IP can change and
> the boards will silently stream into the void. Consider a DHCP
> reservation for the PC once this stops being an experiment.

---

## 2. Validate the software pipeline first (no hardware)

Do this before wiring anything, so any later failure is isolated to
"network or board":

```bash
cd core
python3 tools/read_udp.py 1399 4                             # terminal 1
python3 tools/fake_sensor.py 1399 3 20 127.0.0.1 ESP32_A raw6  # terminal 2
```

Expected: lines reading `fields= 7 | ESP32_A,...`. If this works, the
receiving side is fine.

## 3A. ESP32 + MPU-6050

### Wiring

| MPU-6050 (GY-521) | ESP32 |
|---|---|
| VCC | **3V3** (not 5V — no ESP32 pin is 5V tolerant) |
| GND | GND |
| SDA | GPIO21 |
| SCL | GPIO22 |
| AD0 | GND (I2C address 0x68) |

### Toolchain

```bash
arduino-cli config add board_manager.additional_urls \
  https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

### Flash

```bash
cd firmware/wifi/mpu_wifi_esp32
cp secrets.example.h secrets.h     # then edit: SSID, password, DEST_IP, DEVICE_ID
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 .
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX --fqbn esp32:esp32:esp32 .
```

### Verify
Open the USB serial monitor at 115200. You should see
`WHO_AM_I = 0x68 (MPU-6050 OK)`, the IP the router assigned, and a status
line every 5 s with the frame count and the last frame sent.

## 3B. Arduino Nano (or Uno) + ESP-01S

Written for the Nano, which is the board this project has. The sketch is
board-agnostic: on an Uno, swap the FQBN for `arduino:avr:uno` and expect a
`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` port. Everything else — pins, wiring, AT flow — is
identical.

### Prepare the module first (once)

SoftwareSerial on a 328P cannot keep up with the ESP-01's factory 115200
baud. Talk to the module with a USB-TTL adapter and drop it to 9600
**before** using it with this sketch:

```
AT                          -> OK          (module alive)
AT+GMR                      -> firmware version
AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0    -> OK          (persists across reboots)
```

If `AT` does not answer: check `CH_PD` is tied to 3.3V (the module does
nothing without it), and that your supply is not browning out.

### Wiring

| Signal | Connection |
|---|---|
| MPU VCC | Nano 5V (the GY-521 has its own regulator) |
| MPU GND / SCL / SDA | GND / A5 / A4 |
| ESP-01 VCC | **Separate 3.3V supply** (~300 mA peaks), 100 µF cap nearby |
| ESP-01 GND | GND, **common with the Nano** |
| ESP-01 CH_PD | 3.3V |
| ESP-01 TX | Nano pin 2 (3.3V out is safe for a 5V input) |
| ESP-01 RX | Nano pin 3 **through a level shifter** (or 1 kΩ series + 2 kΩ to GND) |

> Wiring the Nano's 5V TX straight into the ESP-01's RX is the classic way
> to kill the module. Do not skip the divider.

### Flash

```bash
cd firmware/wifi/mpu_wifi_avr_esp01
cp secrets.example.h secrets.h     # then edit: SSID, password, DEST_IP, DEVICE_ID
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:nano .
arduino-cli upload -p $PORT --fqbn arduino:avr:nano .
```

`$PORT` is the Nano's: `/dev/cu.wchusbserial*` (CH340) or
`/dev/cu.usbserial-*` (FTDI), found with `ls /dev/cu.*` — **not** a
`usbmodem` name. If the upload fails with `not in sync` / `stk500_recv`, the
clone has the old bootloader: use `arduino:avr:nano:cpu=atmega328old` in
both commands.

### Verify
Open the USB serial monitor at 115200: the sketch echoes every AT exchange,
so a failure names its own step — `AT` (module/power/baud), `AT+CWJAP`
(SSID/password/5 GHz), or `AT+CIPSTART` (destination).

## 4. Confirm the frames arrive

```bash
cd core
python3 tools/read_udp.py 1399 10
```

Expected: `fields= 7 | YOUR_DEVICE_ID,ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz`. Check that with
the sensor **still and flat**, `az ≈ 1.0` and `ax, ay ≈ 0` — that is the
accelerometer reading gravity, and it is the single best sanity check on
the whole chain. If |accel| is far from 1 g, the range registers did not
take (see `context.md`, decision 5).

Count the lines to measure the real rate: 10 s should give ~1000 lines from
an ESP32, ~200 from a Nano + ESP-01.

---

## 5. Into Blender

1. Start the core and leave it running:
   `cd core && python3 -m veleta_core`
2. Keep the sensor **still for the first ~3 s**: the core is estimating the
   gyro bias and deliberately emits nothing until that finishes. Watch for
   `gyro bias` in the core's output.
3. In Blender, open the **Veleta** tab in the sidebar (`N`), press
   **Connect**, and set **Sensor → object** in the extension's preferences
   to your scene object's exact name.
4. Hold the sensor in the reference pose and press **Calibrate**. If you
   rely on the core's startup auto-calibration instead, raise
   `CALIB_COUNTDOWN` to 6 for `raw6` sensors — otherwise it calibrates
   before the bias estimate has finished.
5. Move it one axis at a time and check the object follows on the right
   axis and in the right direction. Fix mismatches with the **Axis map**
   and **Sign** fields in the extension's preferences — never in the code.

---

## If there is silence (checklist)

1. PC and board on the **same 2.4 GHz** network?
2. Is `DEST_IP` in `secrets.h` still the PC's current IP? (DHCP moves it.)
3. Firewall: allow UDP 1399.
   ```bash
   # Fedora / Linux
   sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=1399/udp        # temporary, until reboot
   # macOS: System Settings -> Network -> Firewall (or disable for the test)
   ```
4. Does anything reach the machine at all?
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -n -i any udp port 1399
   ```
   Packets here but nothing in `read_udp.py` means a parsing/port problem;
   nothing here means network or board.
5. What does the board's own USB serial monitor say? It reports whether it
   joined and what it is sending — that splits "board is not sending" from
   "PC is not receiving" in one look.
6. ESP-01 only: random resets or `AT` timeouts mid-run are almost always
   **power**, not code. Give it its own supply and a capacitor.
