fake_sensor.py — Fake UDP emitter that mimics the project's WiFi sensors.

Used to VALIDATE the bridge's parsing, fusion and calibration WITHOUT any
hardware on the network (see "Testing without hardware" in ../CLAUDE.md).
It generates CSV frames identical to what a real sensor sends and streams
them to the port the bridge listens on, with the motion animated so the
Blender object visibly moves.

It can emit either profile of the shared protocol (../../docs/protocol.md):

    fused  13 fields — mimics the WitMotion WT901WIFI (angles already fused)
           0=DeviceID 1..3=Acc 4..6=Gyro 7..9=Angle 10..12=Mag
    raw6    7 fields — mimics Arduino/ESP + MPU-6050 (accel+gyro only, the
           bridge fuses it): 0=DeviceID 1..3=Acc 4..6=Gyro

In `raw6` the accel/gyro are generated to be PHYSICALLY CONSISTENT with the
animated angles (gravity projected onto the sensor frame, gyro = analytic
derivative of the angles), so the bridge's complementary filter has real
work to do and its output can be compared against the angles that generated
it. That is what makes this a test and not just a traffic generator.

No external dependencies: standard library only.

Usage:
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py [PORT] [SECONDS] [HZ] [HOST] [DEVICES] [PROFILE]

Defaults:
    PORT    -> LISTEN_PORT from core/config.env (if found), else 1399
    SECONDS -> 0 = indefinite (until Ctrl+C)
    HZ      -> 50 datagrams/second
    HOST    -> 127.0.0.1 (localhost; the bridge listens on 0.0.0.0)
    DEVICES -> WT9AXTEST (one). Several: comma-separate for multi-sensor,
               e.g.  WT53abc,ESP32_A  -> each moves its own object per
               DEVICE_MAP. Each device is animated with a different phase
               so they can be told apart.
    PROFILE -> fused (the WT901WIFI layout). Use `raw6` for the Arduino/ESP
               layout.

Examples:
    # One WT901WIFI-like sensor to the default port, indefinitely:
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py
    # Two sensors at 100 Hz for 20 s (multi-sensor test):
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py 1399 20 100 127.0.0.1 WT53abc,WT53def
    # An Arduino/ESP-like sensor at its realistic 20 Hz:
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py 1399 0 20 127.0.0.1 ESP32_A raw6
    # One of each at once (the bridge must handle both profiles together):
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py 1399 0 50 127.0.0.1 WT53abc fused &
    python3 tools/fake_sensor.py 1399 0 20 127.0.0.1 ESP32_A raw6
